Each section of this book builds on the previous one. Skipping ahead makes the material harder to understand. Please carefully answer the questions without using any outside resources and then use the <term role="bold">Check Me </term> button to check your response for correctness. Keep trying until you complete all tasks correctly. In this book you will learn through practice. 
We are sorry that while <term role="bold">Compare Me </term> button does nothing, we could not remove it.
