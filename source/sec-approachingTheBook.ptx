  <title>How to approach this book </title>
  <p>
<term role="bold">Please follow the sections of this book in order</term>, You should use the <term role="bold">Next</term> button at the buttom of the page to move to the later sections. Each section of this book builds on the previous one. Skipping ahead makes the material harder to understand.
In the following sessions, you will see many practice problems. Please carefully answer the questions without using any outside resources and then check your response for correctness (there is a Check Me button for each question). In this book you will learn through practice. If you didn't answer the questions correctly at the first attempt, please try again until you do all the tasks correctly.
