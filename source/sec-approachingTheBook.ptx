  <term role="bold">Please follow the sections of this book in order</term>. You should use the <term role="bold">Next</term> button at the top or bottom of the page to navigate to the later sections. Each section of this book builds on the previous ones.

  <li>Please carefully answer the questions without using any outside resources, and then use the <term role="bold">Check Me</term> button to check your response for correctness. Keep trying until you complete all tasks correctly. </li>
  <li>Carefully read the feedback you receive in each repsponse. In this book, you will learn through practice and feedback.  </li>
  <li>We are sorry that the <term role="bold">Compare Me</term> button does nothing. Unfortunately, we could not remove it.</li>
  <li>The bar at the bottom of each page indicates the number of activities you have completed for the page. Opening a page counts as one activity.</li>
<li>Finally, the <term role="bold">Mark as Completed</term> button is only to help you track which pages you have completed and which you want to review later. We use your responses to the activities to determine whether you have completed the tasks.</li>
